## How to Play

The goal in Solvaball is to navigate each puzzle and ensure the last remaining balls fall into their designated pockets, with no other balls left on the field. Players can move balls to adjacent tiles or "eat" an adjacent ball to progress. Each ball has a maximum number of moves available; once a ball reaches zero moves, it can no longer be used.
